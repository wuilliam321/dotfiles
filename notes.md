Infosec
No gateway


We already finished our POC, we have an estimation of 1 month but me have some considerations:
 - We are not going to use a getaway (for now), that implies some extra security implementations from our side. We need to check with our InfoSec team.
 - Cloud need to prepare some things from their side because HTTP/2 and gRPC are not used in Peya, so they need to do some research, and next week we'll receive feedback. This could be a blocker.

Out of scope:

## TDD
Think Driven Development
* Put the end goal at first (in business language) then cut it to the minimum testable unit
* Do not refactor without test
* Go small
* Write failing test before fixing a bug (0 bug policy) no matter how small and easy it is
